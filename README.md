 Class Code: IN2381

# My Comments:
The lectures are so kind and good people. They are very generous when giving points. However, lecture are so boring for me since the professor just read the script 
and write it to tablet. So I didnt follow the course. There are 12 exercises which are teaching course to you. 

Also I was expected to learn some quantum programming but it is not in the course.
